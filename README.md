## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html) dataset, which includes:
- 43 different traffic sign classes
- Over 50,000 images in total
- Various image sizes and lighting conditions

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RNA62831/Road-Sign-Classifier.git
cd road-sign-classifier
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

1. To train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

2. To predict using a single image:
```bash
python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg
```

3. To run real-time detection:
```bash
python realtime_detection.py
```

## 📈 Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:
- Multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Dense layers for final classification
